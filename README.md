# Project Structure:

data.csv        # E-commerce data (user, product, interactions)
utils.py        # Data preprocessing and evaluation functions
models.py       # Collaborative filtering model implementations
main.py         # Main script orchestrating the workflow

# Dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy

# Running the Project:

1. Execute the main script:
   python main.py

   This will generate personalized product recommendations for a specific user ID (replace `123` with the desired user ID).

# Further Enhancements:

- Explore advanced algorithms (matrix factorization, hybrid approaches).
- Incorporate additional data sources (reviews, demographics, purchase history).
- Evaluate model performance (click-through rate, conversion rate, user satisfaction).
- Build a real-time recommendation engine.

# Disclaimer:

This is a basic demonstration. Real-world applications often require advanced techniques, considerations for scalability, privacy, and explainability.
