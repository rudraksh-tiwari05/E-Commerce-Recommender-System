E-commerce Recommender System
This project implements a basic recommender system for e-commerce platforms using Python. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend relevant products to users based on their past behavior and similarities to other users.

Project Structure
data.csv: This file stores the e-commerce data, including user information, product information, and user-item interactions (purchases, views, ratings).
utils.py: This file contains utility functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
models.py: This file implements the chosen recommendation algorithms: User-based Collaborative Filtering and Item-based Collaborative Filtering.
main.py: This file serves as the main script, orchestrating the entire workflow: data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and recommendation generation.
Functionality
Data Preprocessing:
Loads the e-commerce data from data.csv.
Performs data cleaning and preprocessing steps:
Handles missing values.
Encodes categorical features.
Model Training:
Implements User-based Collaborative Filtering:
Creates a user-item interaction matrix.
Calculates user similarity based on cosine similarity.
Recommends items based on similar users' purchases.
Implements Item-based Collaborative Filtering:
Creates an item-item similarity matrix based on product features.
Recommends items with the highest similarity scores to a user's purchased items.
Recommendation Generation:
Generates personalized product recommendations for a specific user based on the trained models.


Running the Project
Install required libraries:
Bash
pip install pandas numpy
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Run the main script:
Bash
python main.py
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will print the recommended products for a specific user ID (replace 123 in main.py with the desired user ID).

Further Enhancements
Implement more sophisticated recommendation algorithms like matrix factorization or hybrid approaches.
Incorporate additional data sources like product reviews, demographics, and purchase history for richer recommendations.
Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like click-through rate, conversion rate, and user satisfaction.
Integrate the recommender system into a real-time recommendation engine for a dynamic user experience.
